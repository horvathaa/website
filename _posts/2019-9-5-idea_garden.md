The Idea Garden is a scaffolded help system designed to aid end-user programmers (people who program as part of their job but may have no formal training in software engineering) write more effective code by teaching them fundamental programming strategies and idioms. I assisted in the evaluation of the Idea Garden as an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Burnett's lab.
