The	GenderMag method helps software developers and usability	professionals find and fix software features that may have gender-inclusiveness "bugs". I assisted in the creation and evaluation of GenderMag as a method software developers may employ to create more inclusive software by finding places where software features may be designed to cater to one cognitive processing style over another, where these cognitive processing styles tend to differ by gender. Dr. Burnett is continuing work on this project, so please inquire with her if you would like to try the GenderMag method yourself!
